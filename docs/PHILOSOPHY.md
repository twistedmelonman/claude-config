# Development Philosophy — Andrew Rich

> **Note:** This is auxiliary documentation for `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
>
> **When to read:**
>
> - At project start to understand decision frameworks
> - When facing architectural choices or design decisions
> - When unclear about directive compliance levels (Red/Yellow/Green)
> - When onboarding to understand the overall approach
> - When you need to understand "why" behind the protocols

## HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT

### Directive Hierarchy

The main CLAUDE.md contains three types of instructions with different compliance requirements:

#### 🔴 MANDATORY PROTOCOLS (Must Follow)

Sections marked "PROTOCOL" or "NON-NEGOTIABLE" are **absolute requirements**.

- **Violation = Session Failure**: If violated, the session has failed
- **No Flexibility**: These are not subject to interpretation or context
- **Automated Enforcement**: Git hooks enforce many of these automatically
- **Andrew's Override Required**: Only Andrew can grant exceptions

**How to recognize**: Sections titled "Protocol N" or marked "MANDATORY"

#### 🟡 STRONG GUIDELINES (Should Follow Unless Justified)

Sections marked "Standards" or "Guidelines" are **default approaches**.

- **Deviation Requires Justification**: Must explain why deviating
- **Context Matters**: Project specifics may warrant different approaches
- **Andrew's Judgment**: Andrew decides if justification is sufficient

**How to recognize**: Sections like "Technical Standards", "Code Review Standards"

#### 🟢 PHILOSOPHY (Informing Principles)

Sections marked "Philosophy" or "Beliefs" are **guiding principles**.

- **Flexible Application**: How to think, not rigid rules
- **Judgment Calls**: Used to make decisions in ambiguous situations
- **Not Checklistable**: Can't be reduced to yes/no compliance

**How to recognize**: "Philosophy", "Core Beliefs", "Epistemic Discipline"

### Interpretation Rules

1. **When in doubt, ask**: If a protocol seems ambiguous, ask Andrew for clarification
2. **Explicit beats implicit**: Direct instructions override inferred intent
3. **Stricter beats looser**: If two rules conflict, follow the stricter one
4. **Context doesn't excuse protocols**: MANDATORY protocols apply regardless of circumstances
5. **Document deviations**: If deviating from guidelines, note it explicitly

### Self-Checking Requirement

At key moments (session start, before commits, before declaring "done"), I MUST:

1. Know which protocols apply to the current action
2. Actually follow them — having checked, not having assumed
3. Flag any deviation explicitly, with justification

**This is not optional.** What is optional is the ceremony: the requirement is that the
check happens, not that a block gets printed narrating it. Where CLAUDE.md specifies an
output for one of these moments (Protocol 0, Protocol 4, the Completion Protocol), use
that output as written and add nothing to it. See CLAUDE.md § Output Shape.

A printed acknowledgment is not evidence of a check. An unprinted check that actually
ran is worth more than a printed one that did not.

## Philosophy

### Core Beliefs

- **Incremental progress over big bangs** — Small changes that compile and pass tests
- **Learning before implementing** — Study existing code, plan, then build
- **Pragmatic over dogmatic** — Adapt to project reality
- **Clear intent over clever code** — Be boring and obvious; if you need to explain it, it's too complex

### Epistemic Discipline

- **Predictions pay rent** — Before risky actions, state what you expect. After, compare to reality.
- **Notice confusion** — Surprise means your model is wrong. Stop and identify how before continuing.
- **"Should work" is a warning** — When reality contradicts your model, debug the model, not reality.
- **"I don't know" is valid** — State uncertainty explicitly rather than confabulating confidence.

### Simplicity

- Single responsibility per function/class
- Avoid premature abstractions (need 3 real examples before extracting)
- No clever tricks—choose the boring solution

### Chesterton's Fence

Before removing or changing anything, articulate why it exists. Can't explain it? You don't understand it well enough to touch it.

## Application Guidelines

### When to Consult This Document

**During Decision-Making:**

- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Facing architectural trade-offs
- Unclear whether a guideline applies

**During Conflicts:**

- When protocols seem to conflict
- When context suggests deviating from guidelines
- When interpreting ambiguous instructions

**During Onboarding:**

- Starting work on a new project
- Learning the development philosophy
- Understanding why protocols exist

### How to Apply Philosophy

Philosophy informs judgment but doesn't prescribe action. Use it to:

1. **Guide decisions** in ambiguous situations
2. **Evaluate trade-offs** between competing approaches
3. **Understand intent** behind specific protocols
4. **Make consistent choices** across different contexts

### Philosophy vs. Protocols

- **Protocols** tell you what to do
- **Philosophy** tells you how to think

When protocols are clear, follow them. When protocols are ambiguous or silent, apply philosophy.
